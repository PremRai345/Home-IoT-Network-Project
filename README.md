# Home-IoT-Network-Project
This project designs and simulates a Home IoT Network in Cisco Packet Tracer, integrating IoT devices with a central server for monitoring and control. The home network uses DHCP, while the server uses static IPs. WPA2-secured SSIDs allow secure device communication and remote management.
